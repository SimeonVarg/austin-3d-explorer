/**
 * wayfind.js — "I am here, my next class is in WEL". One field, one pill, one
 * ribbon painted on the real city.
 *
 * ── THE THREE DOCUMENTS THIS FILE OBEYS ─────────────────────────────────────
 *   docs/walk/what-we-can-honestly-say.md   WHAT IT MAY SAY.  Outranks
 *                                           everything else, including the
 *                                           interface doc, on every question of
 *                                           wording. Every string the user can
 *                                           read lives in the SAY block below
 *                                           and is quoted from §11 of that file.
 *   docs/walk/graph.md                      what the graph is and what it costs.
 *   docs/walk/interface.md                  what it looks like.
 *
 * `interface.md` was written on 2026-08-06 and the honesty audit on 2026-08-15,
 * and the audit CONTRADICTS it in three places. The audit wins, every time:
 *
 *   interface.md said            this file ships
 *   ------------------------     -----------------------------------------
 *   `9 min`                      `6-8 min walk`  — a single number has no
 *                                error bar; §3 of the audit forbids it.
 *   `2 flights up`               `Stairs: 2 sets` — nothing in OSM records a
 *                                landing, so a "flight" is not in the data.
 *   `Step-free: 15 min`          `Avoid stairs`  — "step-free" sounds
 *                                descriptive and reads as a guarantee, and
 *                                1.4 % wheelchair coverage cannot back it.
 *
 * The word "uphill" appears nowhere in the interface and cannot: there is no
 * elevation source in this repo at all. That half of the original pitch does
 * not exist yet and pretending otherwise is the one failure this feature is not
 * allowed to have.
 *
 * ── OFF MEANS OFF, AND THAT IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────────
 * `main` is being screen-recorded for AWS. So the whole module returns on line
 * one unless it is explicitly asked for:
 *
 *     ?walk=1        open the feature
 *     ?from=&to=     route on load (implies walk=1)
 *     WAYFIND.on     the constant that ships the button to everyone. FALSE
 *                    today, on purpose — flip it after the shoot.
 *
 * With none of those, this file adds NO dom, NO map source, NO map layer, NO
 * network request and NO event listener. That is not an argument, it is
 * `scripts/verify/` diffing the two frames; see HANDOFF.
 *
 * ── THE COSTLY THING IS THE GRAPH, SO IT IS NOT FETCHED AT BOOT ─────────────
 * `data/walk_graph.json` is 328 KB raw / 98 KB gzipped and parses in ~1.4 ms.
 * Affordable is not free and it is not proven, so it is fetched on the FIRST
 * OPEN of the panel and never before. Opening the app and never touching the
 * button costs exactly what it costs today.
 *
 * ── HOW THE ROUTE IS DRAWN, AND THE ONE TRICK IN IT ─────────────────────────
 * MapLibre line layers do not depth-test against fill-extrusions; their draw
 * order IS their layer order. So the SAME line geometry is added twice — once
 * under `buildings-3d` and once over it. Under gives a solid ribbon on open
 * ground; over gives a faint dashed hint where the path runs behind a wall. You
 * always know where the route goes and you are never fooled into thinking you
 * can walk through the building. One extra layer, no new render pass, and it is
 * the whole occlusion design.
 *
 * The last leg — walk network to door — is a straight line across whatever is
 * actually there, so it is drawn DASHED and lighter than the routed path. The
 * picture itself tells the truth about which part is surveyed.
 *
 * Public (window) API:
 *   wayfindRoute(from, to, opts)  — resolve two strings and route; returns the
 *                                   answer object (async). Used by the verify
 *                                   scripts as well as by the UI.
 *   wayfindSearch(str)            — the match ladder, for testing
 *   wayfindStats()                — graph health + the last query's timings
 *   wayfindClear()                — remove the drawn route
 *   WAYFIND                       — the taste block (below)

    // exactly as the interface doc specifies. It rendered NINE PIXELS. Not
    // faintly — nine, in a ten-pixel sliver at the far end of the frame, and
    // zero at walking height. Three screenshots looked completely convincing
    // before the isolation test (same pose, route drawn vs cleared, diff the
    // frames) proved that every "ribbon" in them was js/ground.js's Speedway
    // paving, which happens to run exactly where a Jester-to-Welch route runs.
    //
    // The cause: THE GROUND IN THIS APP IS NOT FLAT GEOMETRY. js/ground.js
    // draws its paths, plazas, Speedway and road surfaces as `fill-extrusion`
    // slabs standing a few centimetres proud. Those write into the depth
    // buffer. A 2D line layer placed beneath them in the stack is drawn first
    // and then painted over by every slab it lies on — which is every slab a
    // footpath route lies on, by definition.
    //
    // So the ribbon is a real 1.6 m wide strip of geometry standing
    // ROUTE_H_M proud of the pavement, which is the same answer js/places.js
    // reached for its shopfronts ("a thin slab standing 0.30 m PROUD of the
    // host wall, so they can never z-fight"). It depth-sorts correctly against
    // the ground AND against the buildings, it is a true 1.6 m at every
    // altitude with no zoom expression at all, and it cannot be confused with
    // the basemap because nothing else in the scene is that colour.
